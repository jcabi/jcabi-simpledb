Amazon SimpleDB Object Layer

  Set of classes in
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/simpledb/index.html}<<<com.jcabi.simpledb>>>}}
  is an object layer on top of
  {{{http://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava/}AWS SDK for SimpleDB}}.
  For example, to read an item from your Dynamo table:

+--
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Credentials credentials = new Credentials.Simple("AWS key", "AWS secret");
    Region region = new Region.Simple(credentials);
    Domain domain = region.domain("foo");
    Collection<Item> items = domain.select(
      new SelectRequest().withSelectExpression("SELECT * FROM foo")
    );
    for (Item item : items) {
      System.out.println(item.get("name"));
    }
  }
}
+--

  You can put an item using
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/simpledb/Item.html}<<<Item#put()>>>}} method:

+--
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Domain domain = region.domain("foo");
    domain.put("id", "234");
  }
}
+--

  Read {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/simpledb/index.html}JavaDoc}}
  for more information and examples.

  (you can also download
  {{{http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/jcabi/jcabi-simpledb/${project.version}/jcabi-simpledb-${project.version}.jar}<<<jcabi-simpledb-${project.version}.jar>>>}}
  and add it to the classpath):
